Generates various timeseries at specific locations imported from
locations.m. 

Notation: consistent with plot_ts.m and plot_ts_locs.m
					plotting output are referred to as 
					$model_name_{hist_,}ts$ilocs_$fieldinquestion.{eps,png}.


-) ts_vars.m generates timeseries of the "main" variables 
	 found in $vars (c.f. anomaly_full.m) accompanied by 
	 their respective monthly climatological means.
	
-) ts_anoms.m generates timeseries of the anomalies of the "main" 
	 variables found in $vars (again c.f. anomaly_full.m) accompanied
	 by their respective standard deviations.

-) gam_and_psi.m generates timeseries of the two toy model forcing 
	 functions.

-) evapofrac.m

	Obsolete procedures, now in obsolete/

-) time_series.m computes anomalies and climatology. Using ts_plot.m,
	 it outputs the time series of interest.

-) ts_corr.m computes correlations between anomalies as a time series.
	 Use ts_corr_plot.m for plotting purposes.

	*** ts_plot.m , ts_plot2.m and ts_corr_plot need to be updated 
			to incorporate plot_print.m as in runoff/ts_plot.m
