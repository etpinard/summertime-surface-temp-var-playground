Some very useful shortcurs.
	
	q.m : shortcut to exit MATLAB just like in the shell and in Vim.

	sqz.m	: shortcut for MATLAB's squeeze command.

	sqmean.m : Computes mean (column-wise) of 3D array then squeezes it
	to 2 dimensions. (save a lot of typing ... )
		--- This should probably be sqzmean for consistency instead ...
	
	ssn_rg.m : Computes the seasonal cycle range (i.e. August minus
	June) for a Nmonth x Nlat x Nlon variable.

	dtrnd.m : Generalized MATLAB's detrend function for 3D arrays with
	NaN entries. (as of 03/27 there is much more inside).

	make1d.m : Reshapes 3D or 2D array to a 1D vector.
	
	isthesame.m : Checks if 2 arrays contain the same value by
	computing the maximum distance between their elements.

	isinarray.m : Checks if value is contian in array. 

	exist_all.m : Checks if all variables in string array exist.
	*** Does not work. MATLAB can't check for existance inside a
	function.

	addsheet.m : Add a 'sheet' to an existing 2D or 3D array.

	catsheet.m : Concatenate multiple arrays 2D array of different 
	sizes using NaNs.

	relabel.m : Relabel variable with an additional prefix.

	xmonth.m : Expand an array with $Nmonth time entries to $Ntime
	time entries e.g. repmat Xbar or sig_X to size of X.
	
	x2d.m : Expand a 2D array with to 3D with $Nmonth sheets.
	e.g. x2d(sqmean(X)) has size of X.

	resdown.m : Trim resolution 3D (time,lat,lon) array down to an
	integer multiple of its current resolution.

	my_interp2.m : Interpolate a 2D or 3D array in 2 dimensions from one
	set of [lon,lat] to another.

	my_sort.m : Sort 3D array in the first column (time) and find indices 
	(consistent with input array).
	
	nansync.m : Synchronizes in 2 arrays of the same dimensions such
	that non-NaN values are substituted out by corresponding numbers
	where applicable.

	makenan.m : Set all entries of an array to NaNs with respect to
	some condition.

	cos_weight.m : Weighs input X(time,lat,lon) by the cosine of
	latitude.

	max1d.m : Find maximum value in a 3D or 2D array.
	 
	min1d.m : Find minimum value in a 3D or 2D array.

	mean1d.m : Find (nan) mean value in a 3D or 2D array.

	std1d.m : Find the (nan) std of a 3D or 2D array. 

	mystats.m : Displays the outputs of max1d, min1d, mean1d and std1d
	
	bias.m : Computes the relative two-sided bias of some field.

	abias.m : Computes the relative one-sided bias of some field, that
	is the absolute value of bias.m

	abiaslog.m : Computes the logarithm of the relative one-sided bias
	of some field. 

	Var_expl.m : Computes the fraction of variance explained given 
	the regression residual and the original variance.

	rms.m : Computes the temporal root-mean-square of 1 variable or of a
	difference of 2 variables.
