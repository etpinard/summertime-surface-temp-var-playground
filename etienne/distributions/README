The second generation distribution code that now uses 
../anomaly.m to generate X = Xbar + X' with Xbar a function of month


-) check_saturation.m seeks the best way to trim saturated and
	 completely dry grid boxes for startup_crit.m

-) dist_means.m plots Xbar for all variables in $vars.
	 That is, all "natural" variable of the toy model:
	 (T,m,F, ... but not psi, gamma ...)

-) dist_stds.m same as dist_means but now for sig_X.

-) dist_forcs.m computes statistics of the two forcing functions (i.e.
	 their stds), and verifies the relative magnitude of the parameters
	 lambda, alpha and beta. 
	 --- NEEDS A REBRUSH! but very valuable. 
	 --- Should I put this here or in regressions/

-) coeff_var.m computes the coefficient of variation of all variables
	 natural (good) and derived (to do!).

-) regimes.m seeks to best way to define to the two regimes of
	 evaporation control (refer to correlations patterns in
	 correlations/{control_E,param_E}).

-) dist_varsfull.m computes statistics of the missing vars_full
	 (i.e. Hs, 4 radiation terms) variables.

-) issummer.m "verifies" that summer is indeed JJA (DJF) using
	 cumulative distribution functions for each summer month.
	 --- NEEDS A REBRUSH! but very valuable.

-) monthzero.m has everything month zero related (May or Nov.):
	 it loads and cleans data, computes and plot the ratio of 
	 month zero to the summer mean.
	 --- NEEDS A REBRUSH! but very valuable.
	
-) snow.m presents the snow related variables.

-) bowen.m evaluates the bowen ratio both in clim. mean and anomalies.

-) winter_only.m computes some selected statistics (including some
	 correlations) for the winter months. 

-) spring_only.m computes some selected statistics for the spring
	 months.

-) which_T.m compares the distributions of the surface air temperature
	 (tas.cdf) and the surface skin temperature (ts.cdf).

-) aero_resistance.m evaluate the spatial and temporal variability
	 of the aerodynamic resistance by approx. using T(2m)-T(skin).
