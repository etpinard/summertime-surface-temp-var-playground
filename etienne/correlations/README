Computes various correlations between the variable of the Toy Model.
The year-to-year (i.e. summer-to-summer) wrapped around problem is not
address in these procedures. Instead, month-to-month correlations are
computed (as oppose to traditional "lag-distance" correlations).

Notation: correlation functions are denoted as corr_""". 
 				  monthly correlation fields (or variables) as cor(lag)_""".
 				  summer-averaged correlation fields as Cor(lag)_""".

-) corr_pairs.m compute correlations of a set of variables where
	 the possible variable pairs are determined by combinatorics.

-) corr_depind.m compute correlations of a set of variables with
	 one fixed dependent variable seeking linearly related independent
	 variable. 

-) corr_pairs_plot.m plotting procedure for corr_pairs.m
	 Makes use of plot_monthly.m and plot_summeravg.m

-) corr_depind_plot.m plotting procedure for corr_depind.m.
	 Makes use of plot_monthly.m and plot_summeravg.m

in ./plots/

-) corr_E_FPF0.m compute and plot correlations E to F,P,F_0
	 in a 3 panel figure.

	 and many more ...

-) autolag.m compute the auto-correlation using cor_autolag.m 
	 for a set of variables. 

-) sfc_engy.m	compute correlations between the variables of the
	 surface energy budget.

-) soil_mois.m compute correlations between the variables of the
	 soil moisture budget.

-) forc_resp.m compute correlations between forcing functions and
	 their respective responses.

-) coupling_landatm.m compute correlations between T and m.
	 Also, investigate what temperature variable (skin or surface air
	 temperature) is best to use.

-) coupling_soil.m compute and plots correlations of soil moisture
	 between the top and bottom soil layers.

-) param_E.m seeks the best parameterization for E.

-) parar_H.m seeks the best parameterization for H.

-) param_R.m seeks the best parameterization for R. 

-) param_residual.m evaluates the behavior of E_00' and H_00', the
	 surface energy parameterization residuals.

-) control_E.m computes correlations between E, P, F and F0
	 investigating the spatial distribution of "evaporation control"
	 regimes.
	
-) residual_bias.m investigates if the regression residuals (i.e. the
	 rejections) are correlated w.r.t. their original variables.

-) infiltration.m has some checks regarding taurho, the soil moisture
	 infiltration time scale. Computation is now made by inflt.m .

-) albedo.m investigates correlations between the surface albedo and
	 (among others) soil moisture.m

-) skin_temp.m miscellaneous correlations involving the skin
	 temperature.
