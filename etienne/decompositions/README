Analysis of the variable decompositions in the toy model 
equations. Investigation of the importance of the seasonal cycle,
linearity and relative variability.


-) seasonality.m checks the gain from decomposing in on monthly 
	 basis compared to full summer decomposition. Especially intended
	 for parameters alpha and e to attest their temporal behavior
	 during summer.

-) variability.m evaluates the variability of the monthly means 
	 to the typical variability of around its mean.

-) islinear.m computes "worst-case" coefficient of variations. 
	 Intended for E and P ...


-) check_tau.m verifies the magnitude of the residual in the 
	 the temperature damping parameterization (H' = H_0' + kappa T').
		*** this should be inside a new folder called regressions/.
