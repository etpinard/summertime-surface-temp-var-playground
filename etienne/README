-) Procedures: 

	# ~/proj/etienne/		(parent_dir)

	make_paths.m : Sets up all the needed path to functions,
	procedures and data files.
	
	startup_vars.m : Generates the array containing the names of the
	variables. A useful way to keep track of them.

	startup_thres.m : Selects the soil-saturation threshold for
	trimming lakes, glaciers and other saturated grid boxes.

	startup_full.m : General startup fill for all MATLAB script
	folders. Trims variables to summer only, remove non-land values,
	removes high-latitudes data points, trims saturated grid boxes
	and calls anomaly_full.m
	
	startup_other.m : Holds on to a selected variable and calls
	startup_full.m again for a different data set.

	getnetcdf.m : Extracts main field out of a netCDF file and checks for
	time correspondence with already-extracted fields.

	getnewvar.m : Automates the extraction of a "new" variable. Calls
	getnetcdf.m then proceeds as in startup_full.m.

	summer_only.m : Truncates input arrays in time to include only
	"summer" months for NH and SH grid points. 
	
	land_only.m : Trims to land only excluding ocean, lake and glacier
	(high latitudes) and saturated grid boxed. Uses the criterion set in
	startup_crit.m

	anomaly.m : Computes Xbar, XX and sig_X of variable X(Ntime,Nlat,Nlon).
	That is, the clim. monthly means Xbar(Nmonth,lat,lon), deviations for
	it XX(Ntime,Nlat,Nlon) and the clim. monthly standard deviations 
	sig_X OR variance Var_X (both Nmonth,Nlat,Nlon)

	anomaly_full.m : Computes climatology for the extracted variable
	using anomaly.m. Moreover (it needed) computes every parameter
	needed for Toy Model calculations.

	anomly_sig.m : Computes sig_X from XX using anomaly.m. Useful
	for regression residuals like F0F0 and H0H0.
	
	anomly_Var.m : Computes the variance of X from XX using anomaly.m. 
	Useful when Var_X is considered a better scaling than sig_X.

	corr_inst.m : Computes the monthly instantaneous correlations of a
	pair of variables. Uses anomaly.m

	cova_inst.m : Computes the monthly instantaneous covariances of a 
	pair of variables. Uses anomaly.m

	corr_lag.m : Computes the month-to-month lagged correlations of a
	pair of variables. The "wrap-around" problem is not addressed.
	Correlations are computed for specific month couplets NOT for given
	lags distance.

	cova_lag.m : Computes the month-to-month lagged correlations of a
	pair of variables. As with corr_lag.m, the "wrap-around" problem is
	not addressed.
	
	corr_autolag.m : Same as corr_lag.m but for one variable with
	itself, the autolagged correlation.
	
	cova_autolag.m : Same as cova_lag.m but for one variable with
	itself, the autolagged covariance.

	regrs.m : Computes the (orthogonal) projection of one 3D field 
	onto another. Both the regression coefficient and the (orthogonal)
	residual are outputted. 

	ddt.m : Computes time derivative using the 1st-order forward in time
	FDA. Here too, the warp-around problem is not addressed.

	param_evapo.m : Computes the toy model parameterization of the
	evapotranspiration field.

	param_damp.m : Computes the toy model parameterization of the
	surface energy damping (Flw+Hs).

	param_smres.m : Compute the toy model parameterization of the soil
	moisture budget residual (P'-E'-R').

	tm_param2.m : (Obsolete) Compute all toy model parameterizations.
	Updated notation as of 06/13 (gamma's and nu's).

	tm_param_full.m : Compute all toy model parameterizations as well 
	as Var(T) and Var(m). Updated scheme of 06/17.

	locations.m	: Specifies coordinates of different location around the
	globe requires for time series and scatter plot analysis. Uses
	locs_add.m

	locs_add.m : Converts longitude/latitude coordinate pairs into
	indices of the model's longitude and latitude vectors.

	box_regions.m : Define location 'boxes' for time series analysis.

	box_avg.m : Performs an area average around 'box' given by its
	SW and NE corners.

	box_cat.m : Concatenate every grid point inside 'box' given by its
	SW and NE corners.
