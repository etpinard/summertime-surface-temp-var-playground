in ~/proj/etienne/model_Var_check 

  Comparison of the surface temperature and precipitation in the GCMs
  and 20th century observations for the U. of Delaware data banks.

  Observation data files are in ~/proj/data/obs/

  model_T_dist.m : sig_T and Tbar observations 
  distributions for comparisons.

  model_T_bias.m : Var(T) and Tbar check with observations in
  summer.

  model_T_bias_winter.m : same but for winter.

  model_P_bias.m : Var(P) and Pbar check with obs. in summer.

  model_T_bias_detrend.m : same as model_T_bias.m but with detrended
  GCM and observations.

  model_T_bias_strung.m : same as model_T_bias.m but the a "strung
  together" data set.

 
in ./get_obs/

  A series of procedures for extracting the observation data.

in  ./plots/

  model_and_obs.m compares model and observation sig_T in a 3 panal
  figure.
