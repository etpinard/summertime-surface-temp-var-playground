in ~/proj/etienne/regressions 

	Computes regressions between the variables that we seek to
	parameterize in the toy model equations, namely E', H' and R'.
	Optimal regressing variables are looked for using ratio of the
	regression residual. 

Notation: Regression functions are denoted as regrs_""". 
					Residual ratios are denoted by
					Res_$var_before$var_after(i){,$var_after(ii)} (for multiple
					regressions).


in ./subroutines/		

-) regrs_single.m performs single regressions (i.e. one variable at a
	 time) and computes the ratio of the residual.
	
-) regrs_multiple.m performs succesive (or multiple) regressions and
	 computes the ratio of the 2nd residual.

-) regrs_single_plot.m plotting procedures for regrs_single.m

-) regrs_single_multiple.m plotting procedures for regrs_multiple.m

---------------------------------------------------------------------

in ./plots/

-)	plot_H_param.m : plot_3panels with sig_H/sig_F , 
		Var(H_0)/Var(H) , Var(H_00)/Var(H) .
	
-)  plot_E_param.m : same but for E.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

-) evapo{,_multiple}.m seeks the best parameterization for E, the
	 evapotranspiration using single {or multiple} regressions.

-) evapofrac.m investigates whether parameterizing the evaporative
	 fraction would give us better results than simply E'.

-) bowen.m investigates whether parameterizing the bowen ratio
	 would give us better results than simply E'.

-) dampimg{,_multiple}.m seeks the best parameterization for H, the
	 surface energy damping term.

-) runoff.m seeks the best parameterization for R, the soil moisture
	 runoff term (need to figure out which of mrro or mrros is
	 important). Form the looks, only 1 regression will be sufficient
	 for most locations.

-) sensible.m compares the relative contribution of the sensible heat
	 term Hs in H w.r.t to the Planck term.

-) budget_residual seeks the best parameterization for xi_U' and xi_m'
	 the 2 budget residual functions.

-) residual_bias.m investigates if the regression residuals (i.e. the
	 rejections) have a bias w.r.t. their original variables. 
	 USELESS! This will never be the case when projecting anomalies.
