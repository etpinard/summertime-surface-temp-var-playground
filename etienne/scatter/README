Verifying the proposed dependence relationship, such as 
parameterizations of the Toy Model, via various scatter plots.


-) evapofrac.m computes and plots the evaporation fraction 
	 (LE/F) as a function of soil moisture as well as other 
	 combinaisons involving E, F and {m,m_b} at specific locations.
	 Uses plot_scatter_locs.m for plotting.
	 
-) runoff.m computes Also, contains the same
	 manipulations for the trio of R, P and m.

-) regimes.m seeks to best way to define to the two evaporation 
	 regimes using scatter plots over all grid boxes.

-) param_E.m plots E' as a function of his its parameterization
	 with m and F_0' (see regressions/) to determine residual (E_00')
	 behavior ... among other things.

-) param_H similar to param_E.m but now for H' the temperature
	 damping term.


-) evapofrac_full.m is similar to evapofrac.m but for every grid 
	 point of the globe. Uses plot_scatter_full.m for plotting.
	 --- Not bad, not your best code but good
	
-) coeff_var.m computes the coeff. of variation of temperature 
	 and plots it against the mean soil moisture content as a scatter 
	 plot for all land grid points.
	 --- Needs a brush up, but valuable!
