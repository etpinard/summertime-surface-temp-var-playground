Information about the data and its variables
	
-) In ~/proj/data/gfdl21

	All files have 144 grid points in longitudes and 90 in latitude
	There are the monthly averaged data set from January 1970 to
	December 2000 for a total of 372 time samples or 31 complete years.
	The variables are stored as var(time,lat,lon). The lon vector ranges
	in [0:360]. The lat vector is expressed in degrees north.

	The files are:

	tas.cdf : Surface air temperature in Kelvin units.

	mrso.cdf : Total soil moisture content in kg m^-2.  Includes
	subsurface frozen water but not surface snow and ice.

	hfss.cdf : Surface sensible heat flux in W m^-2.

	mrro.cdf : Surface and subsurface runoff (rate) in kg m^-2 s^-1.

	pr.cdf : Precipitation (rate) in kg m^-2 s^-1. Includes all types
	(rain, snow, large-scale convective, etc).

	rlds.cdf : Surface downwelling longwave radiation in W m^-2.

	rlus.cdf : Surface upwelling longwave radiation in W m^-2.

	rsds.cdf : Surface downwelling shortwave radiation in W m^-2.
	
	rsds.cdf : Surface upwelling shortwave radiation in W m^-2.

	cloud_20c3m.cdf : Total cloud fraction in percent.
	
	conv_precip_20c3m.cdf : Convective precipitation flux in 
	kg m^-2 s^-1. Includes both liquid and solid phases.
