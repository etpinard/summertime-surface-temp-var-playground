Information about the data and its variables
	
-) In ~/nobackup/data/ccsm3

	All files have 256 grid points in longitudes and 128 in latitude
	There are the monthly averaged data set from January 1969 to
	December 1999 for a total of 372 time samples or 31 complete years.
	The variables are stored as var(time,lat,lon). The lon vector ranges
	in [0:360] in degrees east. The lat vector is expressed in degrees
	north.

	# The files are:

	tas.cdf : Surface air temperature (2m) in Kelvin.

	ts.cdf : Surface (skin) temperature in Kelvin.

	ta.cdf : 3D air temperature in Kelvin at 17 pressure levels.

	
	hfss.cdf : Surface upward sensible heat flux in W m^-2.
	
	hfls.cdf : Surface upward latent heat flux in W m^-2.

	huss.cdf : (Surface) Specific humidity in kg/kg.


	mrso.cdf : Soil moisture content (total) in kg m^-2.  

	mrsos.cdf : Moisture content of soil layer (top 0.1 m) in kg m^-2.

	mrro.cdf : Runoff flux (total) in kg m^-2 s^-1.

	mrros.cdf : Surface Runoff flux (top 0.1 m) in mm s^-1.


	rlds.cdf : Surface downwelling longwave flux in air in W m^-2.

	rlus.cdf : Surface upwelling longwave flux in air in W m^-2.

	rsds.cdf : Surface downwelling shortwave flux in air in W m^-2.
	
	rsus.cdf : Surface upwelling shortwave flux in air in W m^-2.


	pr.cdf : Precipitation flux in kg m^2 s^-1. 

	prc.cdf : Convective precipitation flux in kg m^2 s^-1.


	snw.cdf : Surface snow amount where land in kg m^-2.

	mrfso.cdf : Soil frozen water content (full column) in kg m^-2.
	
	
	ua1000.cdf 

	va1000.cdf

	U1000.cdf ... does not work
