Information about the data and its variables
	
-) In ~/nobackup/data/hadgem1

	All files have 192 grid points in longitudes and 145 in latitude
	There are the monthly averaged data set from January 1969 to
	December 1999 for a total of 372 time samples or 31 complete years.
	The variables are stored as var(time,lat,lon). The lon vector ranges
	in [0:360] in degrees east. The lat vector is expressed in degrees
	north.

	# The files are:

	tas.cdf : Surface air temperature (2m) in Kelvin.

	ts.cdf : Surface (skin) temperature in Kelvin.
	
	ta.cdf : 3D air temperature in Kelvins at 16 pressure levels.


	hfss.cdf : Surface upward sensible heat flux in W m^-2.
	
	hfls.cdf : Surface upward latent heat flux in W m^-2.


	mrso.cdf : Total soil moisture content in kg m^-2.  

	mrsos.cdf : Moisture in upper 0.1 m of soil column in kg m^-2.

	mrro.cdf : Surface and subsurface runoff flux in kg m^-2 s^-1.

	mrros.cdf : Surface Runoff flux (top 0.1 m) in mm s^-1.


	pr.cdf : Precipitation flux in kg m^2 s^-1. 

	prc.cdf : Convective precipitation flux in kg m^2 s^-1.


	rlds.cdf : Surface downwelling longwave flux in air in W m^-2.

	rlus.cdf : Surface upwelling longwave flux in air in W m^-2.

	rsds.cdf : Surface downwelling shortwave flux in air in W m^-2.
	
	rsus.cdf : Surface upwelling shortwave flux in air in W m^-2.


	snw.cdf : Surface snow where land in kg m^-2.

	mrfso.cdf : Soil frozen water (full column) content in kg m^-2.

	
	uas.cdf : Zonal surface wind in m/s (+ for eastward)

	vas.cdf : Meridional surface wind in m/s (+ for northward)

	Uas.cdf Surface wind speed in m/s 
	(computed and interpolated from uas.cdf and vas.cdf 
	 with ./get_Uas.sh).
