	# tas.cdf :  ensemble of 'tas' from 1969 to 1999 (historical run),
							 at 2.5 deg x 2.5 deg resolution.

	# tas_ymonvar.cdf : ensemble mean of monthly 'tas' variance from 1969 to
											1999, at 2.5 deg x 2.5 deg resolution.
	
	# tas_ymonvar_1member.cdf : ensemble mean of monthly 'tas' variance 
	                            from 1969 to 1999, 
															at 2.5 deg x 2.5 deg resolution, 
															1 member per model.
	
	#	ccsm4_tas.cdf : NCAR's CCSM4 'tas' 1969-1999, original resolution
	
	# hadgem2-es_tas.cdf : Hadley Centre's HadGEM2-Earth System 'tas' 
												 1969-1999, original resolution

	# {ccsm4,hadgem2-es}_tas_144x73.cdf : same as above, now on 2.5 deg
																				by 2.5 deg resolution

	Computation are made by :
	
	# ./cmip5_ensemble.sh (ensemble of 'tas' 1969-1999 ) 

	# ./cmip5_Var_ensemble.sh (ensemble of monthly Var('tas'))
	
	# ./cmip5_Var_ensemble_1member.sh (ensemble of monthly Var('tas') 
																		  1 member per model) 


	# Complete list of models used in the ensemble is in models_list.txt

	see @data_dargan :
	/home/disk/pynchon/dargan/cmip5/historical/tas/2d/ 

	** The GISS model had to have been taken out of the ensemble (done
	in ./cmip5_ensemble.sh) as its year entries are not consistent with
	the other member: years in [1850:1875] are repeated. Strange.

Information about where to get CMIP 5 model variables

-) Catalyst message board --> ../data_message_board.sh

-) Monthly precipiation (pr_*) and evaporation (evspsbl_*) 
	 for at least 36 different CMIP5 models. Most of them 
	 for the entire 20th century, through some of them are only late 
	 20th (e.g. 1976-2005).

	 $ ssh pynchon
	 /home/disk/pynchon/dargan/cmip5/historical/precip/2d/

-) Surface radiation fluxes. For about 20 models.

	 $ ssh pynchon
	 /home/disk/pynchon/dargan/cmip5/historical/surf/2d/

-) 2m temperature (tas_*). Less than 20 models.
	 
-) Surface temperature (all ensemble members)
